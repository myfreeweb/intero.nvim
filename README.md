Do you use [Neovim](https://neovim.io) to work on Haskell code?
Do you want really, *really fast* autocompletion and stuff?
Do you already [use GHCi a lot](http://chrisdone.com/posts/haskell-repl)?

Well, this project is for you.

So,

- GHCi is the Haskell REPL. It has a `:complete` command.
- [Intero](https://github.com/chrisdone/intero) is a fork of GHCi that adds `:uses`, `:loc-at`, `:type-at`.
- [My fork of intero](https://github.com/myfreeweb/intero) adds a MessagePack RPC server that exposes those commands!
- This plugin connects to that server using Neovim's built-in MessagePack RPC client.

As a result, you get very robust and lightning fast omni-completion, go-to-definition, go-to-uses, type-of-expression.

## Installation

1. Clone `https://github.com/myfreeweb/intero.git` with `git` and install with `stack install`
2. Install this plugin (`https://github.com/myfreeweb/intero.nvim.git`) with your favorite Vim package manager
3. Run the REPL at your project root with `stack ghci --with-ghc intero`
4. Configure your Neovim!

Note for Linux users: make sure you are using the openbsd netcat variant, which supports connecting to UNIX sockets. For Arch Linux use the openbsd-netcat package.

Example `ftplugin/haskell.vim`:

```viml
setlocal omnifunc=intero#omnifunc

vnoremap <buffer> <Leader>G :InteroGoto<CR>
vnoremap <buffer> <Leader>T :InteroType<CR>
vnoremap <buffer> <Leader>U :InteroUses<CR>
nnoremap <buffer> <Leader>m :call intero#ensurebufmodule()<CR>:call VimuxSendText(":m + ".b:intero_module."\n:reload\n")<CR>
```

(The last line uses [Vimux](https://github.com/benmills/vimux) to tell Intero to load the current module.)
